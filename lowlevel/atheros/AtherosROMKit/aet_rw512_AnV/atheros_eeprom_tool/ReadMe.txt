AppWizard has created the following resources:

atheros_eeprom_tool.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

atheros_eeprom_tool.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file atheros_eeprom_tool.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file, which contains a smaller version (16x16)
    of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
    file atheros_eeprom_tool.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named atheros_eeprom_tool.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
