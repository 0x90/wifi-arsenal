//
// This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
// The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
// written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
// This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
//
// Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
// This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
// except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
// with every copy.
//
// To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
// MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
// needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
// will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
