 * required. When TLS is enabled (e.g., by enabling EAP-TLS or EAP-PEAP), the
 * crypto library used by the TLS implementation is expected to be used for
 * non-TLS needs, too, in order to save space by not implementing these
 * functions twice.
 *
 * Wrapper code for using each crypto library is in its own file (crypto*.c)
 * and one of these files is build and linked in to provide the functions

 *  COPYRIGHT (C) 1986 Gary S. Brown.  You may use this program, or
 *  code or tables extracted from it, as desired without restriction.
 *
 *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
 *  polynomial is
 *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
 *
 *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
 *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
 *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
 *  the MSB being 1
 *
 *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which
 *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit
 *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our
 *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we
 *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in
 *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit
 *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way
 *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART
 *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit
 *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit
 *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly
 *
 *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes
 *
 *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so
 *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback
 *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera
 *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values
 *
 *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc
 *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some
 *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by
 *      using byte-swap instructions
 *      polynomial $edb88320

//
// This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
// The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
// written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
// This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
//
// Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
// This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
// except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
// with every copy.
//
// To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
// MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
// needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
// will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

 * The Core Interface Layer provides basic services for accessing and
 * managing the DWC_usb3 hardware. These services are used by both the
 * Peripheral Controller Driver and the On The Go Driver.
 *
 * The CIL manages the memory map for the core so that the PCD and OTG drivers
 * don't have to do this separately. The CIL also performs basic services
 * that are not specific to either the Device or OTG modes of operation.
 * These services include all functionality that requires specific
 * knowledge of the CSR layout or the DMA descriptor (TRB) layout. Also
 * included are services for invoking each of the commands provided by
 * the DGCMD and DEPCMD registers (see the "Control and Status Registers"
 * chapter of the USB3 controller databook for details).
 *
 * The Core Interface Layer has the following requirements:
 * - Provides basic controller operations.
 * - Minimal use of OS services.
 * - The OS services used will be abstracted by using inline functions
 *   or macros.

 * This file implements the Peripheral Controller Driver.
 *
 * The Peripheral Controller Driver (PCD) is responsible for translating
 * requests from the Function Driver into the appropriate actions on the
 * DWC_usb3 controller. It isolates the Function Driver from the specifics
 * of the controller by providing an API to the Function Driver.
 *
 * The Peripheral Controller Driver for Linux will implement the Gadget API,
 * so that the existing Gadget drivers can be used. (Gadget Driver is the
 * Linux terminology for a Function Driver.)
 *
 * The Linux Gadget API is defined in the header file
 * <code><linux/usb/gadget.h></code>. The USB EP operations API is defined
 * in the structure <code>usb_ep_ops</code> and the USB Controller API is
 * defined in the structure <code>usb_gadget_ops</code>.
 *
 * An important function of the PCD is managing interrupts generated by the
 * DWC_usb3 controller. The implementation of the DWC_usb3 device mode
 * interrupt service routines is in pcd_intr.c.
