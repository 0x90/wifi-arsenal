    <tr>
      <td>* In active mode the WiFi device sends out probe request and waits
        for answers. The data obtained from these answers is shown.</td>
      <td>* When you use KisMAC passively the WiFi device is switched into
        "monitor mode". It waits silently for any valid packets and this data
        is used to derive the network structure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- Probe requests can be easily detected, even by people using
        KisMAC in passive mode.</td>
      <td>+ Passive sniffers cannot be detected</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- The sniffer cannot see raw data, therefore PCAP logging and
        cracking will not work.</td>
      <td>+ Only passive devices can perform WEP cracking and logging of
      data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>* WPA networks can be found in active mode now.</td>
      <td>* WPA and LEAP detection is possible</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- Active programs cannot see hidden networks (per definition).</td>
      <td>+ KisMAC can find and reveal hidden networks if used in monitor
      mode</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+ You will not lose your WiFi connectivity (it will only become
        slightly slower because of all the probing)</td>
      <td>- KisMAC will need to load a replacement for your normal driver in
        order to switch the device into monitor mode. Connectivity will be
        lost.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+ Airport Extreme is supported.</td>
      <td>+ Airport Extreme cards are now supported as well.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Basically: If you have an active mode driver,  you will be able to find
open, WEPed and WPAed networks. You will not be able to crack these networks
or find closed networks.<br>
