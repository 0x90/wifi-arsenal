README
======

Python WiFi is a Python module that provides read and write access to a
wireless network card's capabilities using the Linux Wireless Extensions.
It was initially developed by Roman Joost with advice from Guido Goldstein
of Infrae.  It is currently maintained by Sean Robinson.

More information is available at http://pythonwifi.tuxfamily.org.  A
mailing list for announcements and developer discussion is available at
pythonwifi@lists.tuxfamily.org.

Check the ./docs/feature_matrix_*.txt files for a detailed list of what is
implemented.  This may not work with 64-bit Linux kernels, I would appreciate
reports of success or failure on such systems.


Example Applications
--------------------
The examples directory contains iwconfig.py and iwlist.py, which are sample
re-implementations of iwconfig and iwlist.  These scripts use the pythonwifi
module to duplicate the functionality of those programs as closely as possible.

Python WiFi Users
-----------------
The methods in the Wireless class are the highest level interace. An example
program, which prints the ESSID and the association mode:

>>> from pythonwifi.iwlibs import Wireless
>>> wifi = Wireless('eth1')
>>> wifi.getEssid()
'romanofski'
>>> wifi.getMode()
'Managed'
