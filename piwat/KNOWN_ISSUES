A list of known issues for second alpha release:

These are all currently being worked on:
 > HTTPS Interception is/isn't working. It's not reccomended you use it anyways
 > Injection Proxy occasionally crashes. It's not been looked into why.
 > BEeF is slow

These are also being worked on as features:
 > Automated, Remote MSF Payloads

Stuff I'm not really working on yet:
 > Security*

* It's a security product meant for legitimate testing.
  if you're using this in an environment you might get counter-attacked in, 
  you'll want to change the default MSFRPC, User, BEEF, and other passwords.
